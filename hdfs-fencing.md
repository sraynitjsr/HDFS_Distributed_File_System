# HDFS High Availability Fencing

## Overview
In Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) High Availability (HA) setups, fencing is a critical mechanism to prevent split-brain scenarios and ensure data integrity during failover events. HA ensures continuous operation by maintaining two NameNodes: one active and one standby. However, when the active NameNode fails, fencing mechanisms are employed to ensure that only one NameNode becomes active and the other is prevented from accessing shared resources.

## Fencing Mechanisms
1. **Shoot the Other Node in the Head (STONITH)**:
   - Involves powering off or resetting the failed node to prevent it from accessing shared resources.

2. **Network-Based Fencing**:
   - Involves isolating the failed node from the network to prevent it from communicating with other nodes.

3. **Storage-Based Fencing**:
   - Involves isolating the failed node from the shared storage to prevent it from accessing or modifying data.

4. **API-Based Fencing**:
   - Involves using APIs provided by the underlying infrastructure (such as a cloud provider) to isolate the failed node.

## Choosing Fencing Mechanisms
The selection of a fencing mechanism depends on various factors including:
- Underlying infrastructure
- Desired level of automation
- Specific requirements of the Hadoop cluster

## Importance of Fencing
Fencing ensures the integrity and availability of data in a distributed system like HDFS, particularly in HA configurations where rapid failover is crucial to minimize downtime.
