# HDFS High Availability with Zookeeper Failover Controller

## Overview
In Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) High Availability (HA) setups, the Zookeeper Failover Controller plays a crucial role in managing the failover process between the active and standby NameNodes. Zookeeper, a distributed coordination service, is used to elect the active NameNode and coordinate failover events.

## Components
1. **Zookeeper**:
   - Acts as a centralized coordination service.
   - Manages the election process to determine the active NameNode.
   - Monitors the health of the active NameNode and triggers failover when necessary.

2. **Failover Controller**:
   - Runs on each NameNode (active and standby).
   - Monitors the health of its local NameNode instance.
   - Interacts with Zookeeper to participate in leader election and failover coordination.

## Failover Process
1. **Election of Active NameNode**:
   - Zookeeper facilitates the election process among the NameNodes.
   - One NameNode is elected as the active node while others remain in standby mode.

2. **Monitoring and Failover**:
   - The Failover Controller continuously monitors the health of the active NameNode.
   - If the active NameNode becomes unavailable or fails, Zookeeper triggers a failover event.
   - The standby NameNode transitions to the active state and takes over the file system's management.

3. **Client Redirection**:
   - Clients accessing the file system are redirected to the new active NameNode to ensure uninterrupted access.

## Benefits
- Provides automated failover capabilities, minimizing downtime in case of NameNode failures.
- Simplifies HA setup and management by leveraging Zookeeper for coordination.
- Ensures data consistency and integrity during failover events.

## Considerations
- Proper configuration and tuning of Zookeeper are essential for reliable failover behavior.
- Network stability and Zookeeper cluster health are critical for ensuring timely failover operations.
